When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to utilize a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local when
you are working with a team and will have multiple people collaborating on one project.
This will allow people to push changes to the remote repository and allow others to pull
those changes to their local repositories. You can also collaborate with other GitHub
users and choose to accept their changes or not.
